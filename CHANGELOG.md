## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-12

Phase 2: Presentation Pipeline + Portable Export (TDD 42, Phase 2).

### Added
- Four presentation adapters bound to current tool contracts: Pixelcoat v0.2.0
  (`pixelcoat-pack/1` shared surface packs), Zoo v0.27.0 (structural kit +
  collision-free dressing, `--skins` consumer), Patina v0.18.0 (base cohesion +
  spec-space dressing manifest), and Lux v0.13.0. Lux is an in-engine Godot 4.7
  addon, not a headless CLI, so its adapter stages the addon and drives a
  headless `godot ... --lux-apply` entry (TDD 24.7).
- Presentation DAG in the planner (`--target presentation`, TDD 15.2): Pixelcoat
  packs + Patina base fan out from the locked shell; Zoo kit waits on Pixelcoat;
  dressing chains Patina -> Zoo; Lux applies last; Dispatch consumes the
  Lux-applied presentation.
- Functional lock (TDD 23.4, 31): a fingerprint of collision, gameplay-anchor
  registry, route graph, and clearance metrics, computed and stored when the
  `functional_shell_locked` gate is approved. Post-art regression recomputes the
  same signatures with identical extraction and diffs them.
- Selective rebuild classification (TDD 30): functional / presentation /
  ambiguous, with ambiguous treated conservatively as functional.
- Portable export (TDD 33): `export` in `portable-godot`, `pure-shell`, and
  `source-authoring` modes; `--format folder|zip` (deterministic ZIP). Writes an
  autoload-free / plugin-free `project.godot`, the required HANDOFF.md language,
  a portable resource manifest, and a license/attribution manifest. Lux
  portability policy: localized runtime (default) or baked presentation (33.6).
- Resource closure scan (TDD 33.5): rejects absolute paths, `user://`,
  unresolved `res://`, required autoloads/plugins, and authoring-repo path
  references; LF's own metadata files are excluded.
- Clean-project portability test (TDD 33.8, 12.12): copies the export into a
  fresh Godot 4.7 project and instantiates the mission scene headlessly, then
  reports a `PortabilityReport` (PASS iff closure clean and engine not failed).
- **Functional regressions block export**: a collision / anchor / route change
  after the art pass fails `export` with exit 2 (Phase 2 exit criterion).
- Example shared Pixelcoat recipes (`examples/shared/pixelcoat/recipes/`).

### Deviations from spec (dev environment)
- The private tool repos 403 from the network, so all four presentation adapters
  are bound to their documented contracts and exercised via stub CLIs (TDD 37.3),
  as in Phase 1. Real-tool smoke (37.5) is dev-only and unrun here.
- Lux is in-engine; its apply + the clean-project instantiate run against a stub
  `godot` that answers `--version`, `--lux-apply`, and `--lf-portability-check`.
- The scheduler still runs sequentially (parallelism is Phase 4); it already
  respects resource-class caps.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-12

First package. Phase 1: Headless Orchestration Core (TDD 42, Phase 1).

### Added
- Workspace format and source-control-friendly layout (`factory.project.json`,
  `tools.local.json` / `tools.lock.json`, per-mission tree), rebuildable
  per-workspace SQLite index (`.level_factory/index.sqlite`).
- Canonical/deterministic JSON + SHA-256 hashing as the determinism foundation.
- Domain model (project, batch, brief, candidate, job, artifact, issue,
  approval) and mission/job state machines (TDD 12, 13, 14).
- Adapter SDK: `ToolProbe`, `PlannedCommand`, `ToolAdapter` protocol,
  `BaseAdapter`, and a `run_contract_probe` helper that reads a tool's
  machine-readable `contract` command (the Dispatch D12 pattern) instead of
  scraping prose.
- Tool registry + `doctor` (per-tool PASS/WARN/FAIL/NOT_CONFIGURED; a missing
  tool blocks only its own stages).
- Subprocess runner: argument-array execution (never `shell=True`), streamed
  per-attempt logs, process-tree termination on cancel/timeout, POSIX + Windows.
- Content-addressed cache keyed by build fingerprint (adapter+tool versions,
  commit, input digest, seed, output-contract version); immutable blobs,
  hard-link-or-copy materialization, `cache inspect` / `cache prune`.
- Provenance sidecars per artifact + final `build.lock.json` shape.
- DAG planner for the functional pipeline (deli x N -> lot -> laser_tag) plus
  the Dispatch shell-handoff tail (gated on a selected candidate), with
  deterministic seed derivation and a topological scheduler that resumes after
  a restart.
- Normalized validation model (severities/categories, aggregation) with a
  no-false-completion guarantee: a passing run is never labeled fun / balanced /
  multiplayer-verified / network-ready / shipping-ready.
- Approval gates and functional lock with fingerprint-based staleness.
- Adapters bound to current tool contracts: Deli Counter (v0.74.0 /
  gameplay 1.21.0), Lot (v0.17.x), Laser Tag (v0.7.x), Dispatch (v0.3.0 /
  `dispatch.mission.v0.2`, shell-handoff default). Dispatch adapter enforces the
  shell-only handoff (no production controller node, no leaked network ids).
- CLI: `init`, `doctor`, `batch create`, `plan`, `run`, `resume` (via re-run),
  `status`, `validate`, `approve`, `reject`, `cache`, `diagnostics`, with the
  TDD 28.1 exit-code scheme.
- Tests: unit (core, fingerprint/cache, planner/graph, approvals/validation,
  blocking gate), shared adapter contract suite, and a stub-tool end-to-end
  integration proving brief -> handoff, cache reuse, and resume.

### Deviations from TDD v0.2
- Adapters are bound against the documented tool contracts and exercised via
  stub CLIs; the private tool repos were not reachable at build time, so the
  real-tool smoke suite (TDD 37.5) is developer-only and unrun here.
- Phase 2 (presentation adapters: Pixelcoat/Zoo/Patina/Lux, regression) and
  Phase 3 (PySide6 desktop) are out of scope for this package.
- Pure standard library (no third-party runtime deps), matching the rest of the
  Siliconight tooling; `pytest` is a dev-only dependency.
